# Coding test phase 2

## **Setup / installation instructions (on MAC)**

- Open Terminal in your MAC
- in your terminal go to the folder where you want to clone this source code
- type `git clone https://github.com/hongchan88/teleresult_phase2.git`
- Once clone is finished , then install npm type `npm i`
- After npm is installed , type `npm start` to start the server.
- Once server is started , then the server will be ready at http://localhost:8080
- Use browser to check GET API endpoints or use api platform like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to check all the api endpoints include POST method.

#### default data in ./data/orders.js

```
[
  {
    id: "1",
    title: "new mobile order",
    date: "2016-09-22",
    type: "iPhone13",
    customer: "customer-1",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    title: "new mobile order",
    date: "2016-09-22",
    type: "iPhone13",
    customer: "customer-2",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    title: "new mobile order",
    date: "2016-09-22",
    type: "iPhone13",
    customer: "customer-3",
  },
];
```

#### List of API endpoints

POST `http://localhost:8080/orders`

Example, raw JSON body format\
`{ "title": "new mobile order", "type" : "iphone10", "customer" : "customer11", }`

GET `http://localhost:8080/orders`\
GET `http://localhost:8080/orders/{id}`\
GET `http://localhost:8080//orders/{type}/{date}`

## **Description of the solution**

### Why used NodeJs in this project?

- JavaScript is everywhere!! üëç
- Choosing the same language on front-end and also on backend can improve developer productivity üîß
- Easy , simple yet powerfull and flexible. ‚ú®
- Big corporates use Node.js such as in AWS , Netflix , UBER etc üëå
- Node.js has strong community which provides numerous libraries and reusable templates are available. üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Project structure

- Used MVC architectural pattern which is most popular architectures for applications.
- Separate functions in controller , data and router folder and each have own functions.
- This is good coding practice for easy code maintenance which is easy to extend and grow.
- Async function used in controller and data files as if the project is getting data from database service.
- Error message handled in middleware for GET /orders/{id} and GET /orders/{type}/{date}
- Used validation library to validate input values in server side for POST

### Libraries used

- Express.js
- express-validator
- jest
- supertest

### Why used Express.js?

- Express.js is the most popular node application framework . This means that it has been tested by many developers and most likely common issues have been resolved.
- not all libraries are good just because many developers are using it.But I still chose to use Express.js because Express.js is powerful , flexible and most importantly it is very light weighted library which is really easy to learn if you know javascript.

### Testing using jest

- Testing script was built on `app.test.js`.
- All GET/POST endpoints were tested.

## **List of assumptions for the endpoints**

#### POST http://localhost:8080/orders

- Order ID is created using `Date.now().toString()` in milliseconds
- Latest order will be stored in last of the array.
- turn server on `npm start` and `npm test` to run the jest test

#### GET http://localhost:8080/orders (extra endpoint)

- Get all the orders in the database.

#### GET http://localhost:8080/orders/{id}

- Get the detail of the order that is matching with given ID.

#### GET http://localhost:8080//orders/{type}/{date}

- `related_customers` field will show the list of customers who made orders for the given `type` and on the given `date`.
- `count` field will show the number of orders that is matching with the `type` and the `date` that is given.
- `order` field will show the list of the orders that is matching with the given `type` and `date`. It only shows last 10 orders(latest 10 orders).

## **Any thought on the test and how long it took to build?**

- Spend a few hours to learn Express.js framework to design and implement a simple service.
- After understand the concept of Express.js , developing logic part was fairly straight forward . 4-5hours to build the logic part.
- 3-4 hours to clean the code and researching for a better refactoring option to build simple code to read.
- 1-2 hours to build jest testing script to check if all endpoints working as expected.

## **What else to add more in the future?**

- Develop front-end and
- implement database with mysql , mongodb etc and connect with the api
- more useful libraries can be added such as CORS, morgan , helmet as project gets bigger
